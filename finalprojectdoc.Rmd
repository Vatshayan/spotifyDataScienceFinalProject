```

## Purpose: 

What song attributes lead towards success on the Billboard charts? 


## Background: 

Each year, new songs emerge and become some of the yearâ€™s top hits. Whether it's because of a viral video or a certain time of year, new songs come and go onto the Billboard charts. 



```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
